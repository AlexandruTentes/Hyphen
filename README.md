# Hyphen, a three-dimensional game engine in C++ 

A **game engine** is a software development environment designed to help create games, at its core
it's just a **transformation software** that only converts a piece of data to another form.

Developers use this tool to create games for many platforms: consoles, mobile devices, PCs.
As an example, `REDengine` is the engine in which `The Witcher 3`, the game of the year 2015, was made.

The parts of a game engine differ in complexity and also in the programming field. Such a tool consists of
a rendering engine (used to read the models from files, translate them to a custom file extension if required, load the
data into buffers and then sending them to the GPU to process further through the shaders), a physics engine (this is
where the collision detection between models occurs and many others), sound, scripting, animation, AI, networking, and many others.

The goal of this project is to create an entire game engine for three-dimensional rendering using the programmable
pipeline and the C++ programming language.

#### The process of implementing such a tool will involve: 
- learning the C++ language, OpenGL, GLSL shader language and techniques (ray tracing for example), platformed programming, WINAPI, and distributed computing principles, 
- structuring the whole project using GitLab or GitHub, 
- developing the engine step by step and testing.

---
The main deliverable will be to at least have a basic working engine that consists of: a renderer, physics engine, and networking engine.
The extras would be to add sound and animation functionality and the rest are optional extras.
